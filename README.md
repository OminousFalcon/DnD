# DnD

Hi All,
This is a litle intro and instruction list for starting our DnD 5e Adventure. It is by no means comprehensive, but should help aid and answer some questions. If you end up using other sources, we are playing 5th Edition. 

## Important Programs

We will be using 2 main programs for running the campaign, andf you will need accounts for both of them. 
1. [Roll20](https://roll20.net/welcome)
    1. Where the campaign lives
    2. This is all browserbased, so just open it up as a tab in your chrome/explorer/firefox etc. 
    3. I'll send a join game link through Discord, and you should automatically be placed in the game.
2. [Discord](https://discord.com/)
    1. How we all communicate and talk. No videocam necessary.
    2. Also available for download which makes things much easier imo. 
    4. Click the Invite link, and navigate to the desired channel on the Left. 
    5. Double click the intended voice channel and come talk to us fantastic people.
