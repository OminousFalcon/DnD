## Important Programs

We will be using 2 main progreams for running the campaign, andf you will need accounts for both of them. 
1. [Roll20](https://roll20.net/welcome)
    1. Where the campaign lives
    2. This is all browserbased, so just open it up as a tab in your chrome/explorer/firefox etc. 
2. Discord(https://discord.com/)
    1. How we all communicate and talk. No videocam necessary.
    2. Also available for download which makes things much easier imo.
